This is a nextJS template. 

## Features

- Everything is made on top of standard nextJS template (`npx create-next-app@latest . `)
- strict dependencies are used to make dependencies more manageable
- look for 'template' in the code to find places to change  



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
